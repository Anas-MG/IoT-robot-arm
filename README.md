#### My Approach in this project is creating a simple reliable system that controls the arm and base values online
#### The system should post values of the Robot arm & base to the database, and get them into seperate PHP pages 
#### This due to that we'll need these pages so we can handle it's values by python and post to ROS 

- ##### This is built using HTML, CSS, JS, JQUERY with PHP, SQL database

## Chatbot with Python and IBMWatson:
#### This project's approach is to give the robot the speaking ability so it can handle conversation with stupid humans
#### The system should handle text to speech and speech to text so it can communicate
